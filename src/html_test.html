```python
# This is NOT a header
**This is NOT bold**


<code>haskjdhaksdh
    askjdnakjsd
</code>
<b>Hello <p>World</p></b>  ```

### 4. The "Void" Tags (Self-Closing)
Most tags are pairs: `<p>` opens, `</p>` closes.
Some tags are "Void." They are empty objects. They have attributes (props) but **no children** and **no closing tag**.

You already wrote code for this! This is your `Tag.IMG` case.

* **Image:** `<img src="cat.png" />`
* **Line Break:** `<br />`
* **Horizontal Rule:** `<hr />` (The line across the page)

**Parser Logic:** If you try to give children (value) to a Void tag, your HTML is invalid.

### 5. Semantic Hierarchy
HTML isn't just about "looking bold." It's about meaning.

* `<h1>` is the Main Title (The root of the document meaning).
* `<h2>` is a Section.
* `<h3>` is a Subsection.
* `<p>` is body text.

**Why this matters:**
Your parser needs to respect this hierarchy. A list `<ul>` shouldn't just be floating in space; it usually lives inside the `<body>` or a `<div>`.

### Interactive Check
To test if you see the "Matrix" of HTML structure, look at this simple snippet:

```html
<div>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Click <a href="...">here</a>.</p>
</div>
